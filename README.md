Airport Challenge
=================

My approach to solving the challenge
------------------------------------

* I wrote Plane class with two methods, land and takeoff.  
* These methods call Airport methods receive and sendoff.
* I used guarding conditions in these methods, to "close" the airport in the event of stormy weather.
* I used Plane attribute "location", to help prevent edge case scenarios, such as landing the same plane twice.
